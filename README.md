# cloud-workshops
This is the public repository containing DU Cloud Society's cloud workshops. We aim to include bi-weekly workshops, covering various tools and technologies.

## Recommended Use
Each workshop will have a markdown README. This can be opened to the side in VSCode; in VSCode, right click the file and open to the side, then `Ctrl+Shift+V`. You can copy the file into your working directory to make this easier.

In each workshop, there will be a folder with materials (which should be copied into your working directory), and a fully working example, in case you get stuck.
